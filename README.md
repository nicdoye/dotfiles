# Dotfiles

dotfiles from an old UNIX person. Admittedly, nothing exciting and in the old days,
my .emacs was quite extensive, but times move on. Now you can just see second-rate
rc files for technologies I'm not really an expert in. But maybe something here
will help you, even if it's just one line.
